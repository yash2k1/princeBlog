  description : 'There is a reason why people say that no mission is impossible for Tom Cruise. The global superstar — known for his death-defying stunts — has always tried to bring something extraordinary to the table. Of course, we are talking about Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One, which is releasing on July 12. Tom Cruises latest post proves why the action franchise has fans all over the world. The actor has shared a behind-the-scenes video from the iconic train sequence which was shot in Norway and UK. The clip shows us how Tom Cruise and the team executed it. The actor said, “This train sequence was tricky, but the outcome made it all worth it.” Now, he “cant wait for everyone to see it come to life”. Let us talk about the video that opens to Tom Cruises IMF agent Ethan Hunt who engages in a knife fight atop a train, which is running “60 miles an hour through a real valley.” In the end, the train nose dives into the water. We can see Ethan Hunt and Hayley Atwells Grace barely holding on to a carriage to save their lives.” We all got a glimpse of it in the trailer. So what went behind the train sequence? Director Christopher McQuarrie said, “We started talking about this movie in terms of a sense of adventure, and the action sequence on a train was something we know we always wanted to do. We wanted to build upon our previous films and apply that knowledge to make something practical and real. And, bring this train sequence to another level.” He added, “There was not a surplus of trains available to be wrecked. We had to build the train if we wanted to destroy it. To shoot it was particularly challenging. Not just to execute. But also to design all the different trains and cars that could actually function on working railway tracks. In this level of practical filmmaking, this may never be done again. The train sequence takes us on an adventure that is absolutely huge. There is a big fight on the roof….Going 60 miles an hour through a real valley.”'

Jean-Noel Barrot said Apple would deliver a software update for users in the country in the coming days. Sales of iPhone 12 were halted in France after a regulator detected too much electromagnetic radiation. Apple was told to fix the issue. The firm said the new update would only apply to users in France, where it said a specific testing protocol existed.The American tech giant suggested the radiation findings were a result of that testing regime, and that it was "not a safety concern". The planned update raises questions over Apples plans for iPhone 12, which was released just three years ago, in other countries. Mr Barrot said that the radio frequency regulator (ANFR) would test the new update to check its compliance before iPhone 12 is allowed back on sale in the country. The World Health Organization has previously sought to allay fears about radiation emitted by mobile phones. It says on its website there is no evidence to conclude that exposure to low level electromagnetic fields is harmful to humans.'

"It can highlight a potentially viable sperm before a human can even process what they are looking at," he says. Dr Vasilescu is a biomedical engineer at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS), in Australia, and founder of medical company NeoGenix Biosciences. The system he and his colleagues have developed is called SpermSearch. It has been designed to help men who have no sperm in their ejaculate at all, 10% of infertile men, a condition called non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA).'

Thats because the quality of the snack is what’s most important to lose weight and keep it off. According to one study, nutrient-dense snacks that pack in fiber and protein can help reduce overall calorie intake by helping to ensure you don’t overeat at your main meals. Snacks contribute around 30% of the total daily calories for most of us. Since they make up such a significant portion of our daily energy intake, they should provide essential nutrients, rather than being empty, low-quality choices. For me, eating three meals a day and two snacks is perfect. I’ll have a mid-morning and afternoon snack and try not to eat anything after dinner.'

Bodily changes can take a minute to get used to – and not everyone (re: society) likes the idea of gaining weight or losing energy. Lest we forget, there’s a whole industry built off of incentives to shed pounds. But when it comes to pregnancy, growing is a good thing. Embracing the changes in your body and slowing down movements may help you and your future baby stay safe in the weeks leading up to delivery. Tailoring exercise to support, not manipulate, your body can help support you in your pregnancy. “You are everything your baby needs exactly as you are,” says Laura Fletcher, a certified doula and coach who works with clients on how to increase their fertility.'

More specifically, HIIT allows the body to achieve a higher heart rate for short periods of time. You cross that high-intensity threshold –usually around 80% of maximum heart rate – when you are almost out of breath or unable to hold a conversation, Brown says. Some super high-intensity HIIT workouts will take you right up to 90% or 100% of your max heart rate for a short time to really crank up the heat. To calculate your max heart rate, subtract your age from 220'

This can result from being too sedentary or habitually being in the same position too often. In other cases, “feelings of chronic muscle tightness can also be due to muscle weakness and fatigue,” Such says. This could be a sign that the muscle group needs to be strengthened. “The body works on a simple principle of ‘if you don’t use it, you lose it,’” Patel adds. Therefore, if you don’t exercise or stretch much, that can reduce the natural movement and integrity of the muscle fibers and tendons, he says.

  heading : 'Health Benefits of Bananas',
  description : 'Bananas are a great source of potassium. One medium-sized banana provides 10% of the daily value of potassium, a mineral that lessens the effects of sodium in your body. The more potassium you eat, the more sodium you may lose through urine. Research shows that consuming potassium also helps to ease the tension in your blood vessels, which in result, helps lower blood pressure. Potassium is also vital for kidney function, and eating bananas regularly may help play a role in keeping your kidneys healthy. However, if diagnosed with any type of kidney disease, one should speak with their physician about their potassium intake. The intake of dietary fiber has been associated with a decrease in cholesterol levels; however, most individuals do not meet the RDA (25-30g per day). One medium-sized banana provides about 3 grams of fiber. Furthermore, the lower your cholesterol levels the lower your risk for heart disease. Fiber is also known to aid in satiety which may help with weight management. This tropical fruit is also good for our digestive tract, as it decreases the risk for constipation and diarrhea. Lastly, since fiber is known to digest more slowly in our bodies, studies have supported that it may not cause huge spikes in our blood sugar.'

Taking us by surprise, Gauahar was seen performing tricep muscle exercises considered effective for toning the arms like a pro. “Four months postpartum,” shared Gauahar in an Instagram Stories, adding that despite a “red-eye flight to Dubai”, she didn’t give up on her progress and turned up to work out. “Not leaving my progress even after a red-eye flight to Dubai,” she mentioned and tagged her fitness trainer.'

  description : 'Sweet potatoes can be your best friend when you get hungry very often. They help you stay full for longer making it easier to consume fewer calories. However, there is more to them than that. “They are packed with nutrients which when cooked properly can provide multiple health benefits,” says Ramya Mahesh, dietitian at Sathwaa Nutrition, Bengaluru. She adds that the best method to retain maximum nutrients is to boil them rather than frying or baking. “Keep the skin as it further helps in retaining the nutrients,” says Mahesh.'

  description : 'In the ever-evolving landscape of dietary trends and fads, nutritional powerhouses such as whole grains have been unjustly pushed to the sidelines. Often overshadowed by fancier counterparts of the food world, whole grains, however, deserve the spotlight for their rich history and health benefits. They are getting it now, it would seem. For several hundred years, grains have been an integral part of our diets, playing a pivotal role in shaping human evolution. The transition from nomadic hunting and gathering to settled agricultural communities was made possible by the strategic cultivation of grains. This shift allowed a steady availability of food and altered the course of human civilisation. '

  description : 'Caffeine is a natural chemical that activates the central nervous system, which means that it revs up nerves and thought processes. Regular caffeine consumption, from coffee and/or tea, has been shown to increase short-term focus and alertness, as well as long-term memory. Although most people enjoy caffeine’s “revved up” effect, some people are caffeine-sensitive and are left feeling jittery or ill after ingesting a dose. If you fall into the second group, you’ll want to eliminate caffeinated beverages or adjust your intake to match your personal tolerance. Those with sleeping problems or insomnia may need to stop drinking caffeinated beverages up to eight hours before bedtime (or omit entirely).'

  description : 'Eggs, chicken, and turkey are rich in high-quality, lean protein and a variety of nutrients. Just remember to remove the skin and reduce the number of egg yolks to keep your heart and waistline in good shape! Skinless poultry offers lean protein, which can help you maintain a healthy weight and increase your lean muscle mass. Egg whites are also a terrific source of high-quality protein. Eating egg whites and skinless poultry can also help keep your blood sugars in check, which lowers your risk of type 2 diabetes and helps to stabilize your mood. Skinless poultry is a good source of B vitamins too. Vitamin B6, in particular, protects against age-related memory decline and maintains healthy hair. This vitamin also helps create dopamine, a mood neurotransmitter that may reduce PMS symptoms. Selenium in eggs, chicken, and turkey is an antioxidant that maintains healthy skin and joints.'

Fruit is a high-quality carbohydrate that is rich in vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and fiber. The fiber in fruit comes in two forms — soluble and insoluble — and it can be a big help when it comes to weight loss. The soluble fiber in fruit stabilizes blood sugar, keeps you feeling full, controls your hunger, and it may also lower cholesterol and blood pressure. Plus, it helps to temper blood sugars by slowing the absorption of carbohydrates into your bloodstream after meals, which can reduce your risk of type 2 diabetes and help keep your mood and energy levels steady. Insoluble fiber adds bulk to your food so you can eat more of it without adding extra calories.'

  description : 'There is nothing quite like delicious desserts on a stressful day, after all ‘stressed’ spelled backward is ‘desserts’, making it one of the best ways to de-exhaust after a long busy day at work and give the much-needed energy boost! While most of us who are on a strict diet try to refrain from eating sweets due to their high sugar content and calories, it is obvious for us to look for healthier alternatives to satiate our sugar cravings.'

  description : 'When we think of iconic dishes from around the world, we often assume they have existed for several centuries. However, this is not always the case. Surprisingly, some of the most famous dishes are not as old as you might think. “There is a significant chance that your grandparents, parents, and even you are older than some of the world’s most popular dishes,” Taste Atlas posted on Instagram. The experiential travel online guide went on to share a list of popular dishes that were created relatively recently. The list also included India’s most iconic dish – butter chicken. While you might have believed that this classic dish is older than anyone could imagine, it was actually invented only in the 1950s.'

  description : 'What makes for the ultimate beer drinking experience? Some like theirs in a frosty glass, others with a wedge of lime. But when it comes to froth – or the head as it’s commonly known – what’s the best amount and how can it be achieved? Too much froth and you’re left with a smear of bubbles across your face and hanging from your nose as you desperately try to get at the beer beneath. But too little will cause problems in your stomach. You see, if there’s no foam the CO2 stays dissolved in the beer. If you then eat something, the foam erupts in your stomach rather than the glass, causing beer bloat.'
